# network-sceince practice

Comparing 3 different graphs on node & edge failures. Also in this code, sample graphs have same node number and degree mean in order to have a fair comparison. 
Note that this results are ust generated with small number of simulation and small numbers. If you want to have a better vision of these comparisons, increase number 
of simulations and graphs number in order to have a better result.
